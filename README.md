# Memoization
Reffered to the logic and devised my own from that for this game.

The game tests your memory.

**Procedure:
Step 1:** Press any key to start

**Step 2:** Click on the tile that blinks
On correct choice of the tile you move to the next level as visible on the top of the screen.

**Step 3:** Upon seeing a new tile blinking, first click on the previous pattern of tiles and then click on the latest tile.

E.g: Round 1 : Red tile blinks->Clicking on the Red tile takes you to the next level.
Round 2: Green tile blinks->Click on the Red tile and then on the Green tile and it takes you to the next level.

Round 3: Yellow tile blinks-> Click on the Red, Green tiles first and then click on the yellow tile.
Till you follow the correct pattern you move to the next level and the game continues.

**Step 4:** If made a wrong choice, press any key to restart the game.
